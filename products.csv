   Product Description:
  </strong>
  Brocade – EMC 8, 16 and 24-port 8 Gbit/sec SAN switch
  <br/>
  This Brocade switch is manufactured for EMC and is known as the EMC Connectrix DS-300B. Good port density and scalability for a mid-range enterprise SAN.
  <br/>
  Minimum ports are 8 and can be upgraded 8 at a time. This allows you to start smaller and at a cost-effective price point and build out as needed.
  <br/>
  This switch is becoming more affordable and is flexible enough for entry-level SANs or as core to edge in SAN environments.

  802.11ac Wave 2 support: Provides a theoretical connection rate of up to 2.6 Gbps per radio—roughly double the rates offered by today’s high-end 802.11ac access points.
  <br/>
  High-density experience: Best-in-class RF architecture that provides high-performance coverage for a high density of client devices, giving the end user a seamless wireless experience. Features include custom hardware in 802.11ac Wave 2 radios, Cisco CleanAir®, Cisco ClientLink 4.0, cross-access point noise reduction, and an optimized client roaming experience.
  <br/>
  Multi User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technology: Supporting three spatial streams, MU-MIMO enables access points to split spatial streams between client devices, to maximize throughput.
  <br/>
  Multigigabit Ethernet support: Providing multiple gigabit uplink speeds of 2.5 Gbps and 5 Gbps in addition to 100-Mbps and 1-Gbps speeds. All speeds are supported on Category 5e cabling for an industry first, as well as 10GBASE-T(IEEE 802.3bz) cabling.
  <br/>
  Dual 5-GHz radio support: Enables both radios to operate in 5-GHz client serving mode, allowing an industry-leading 5.2 Gbps (2 x 2.6 Gbps) over-the-air speed while increasing client capacity.

  Aironet 2700 series of Wi-Fi access points (APs) delivers industry-leading 802.11ac performance at a price point ideal for plugging capacity and coverage gaps in dense indoor environments. The Aironet 2700 series extends 802.11ac speed and features to a generation of smartphones, tablets, and high-performance laptops now shipping with the faster, 802.11ac Wi-Fi radios. The Aironet 2700 series supports 802.11ac “Wave 1” in its first implementation, providing a theoretical connection rate of up to 1.3 Gbps. That’s roughly triple the rates offered by today’s high-end 802.11n APs. The boost helps you stay ahead of the performance and bandwidth expectations of today’s mobile worker, who usually uses multiple Wi-Fi devices instead of just one.

  With service provider-friendly hardware and mission-specific software, the Cisco Catalyst 3750 Metro Series is the first access switch optimized for both the Ethernet-to-the-home (ETTH) triple-play services and Ethernet-to-the-business (ETTB) VPN services. It provides the most complete security solution for Metro Ethernet access that covers subscriber, switch, and network protection. The Cisco Catalyst 3750 Metro Series supports multiple software images to provide a “pay-as-you-grow” deployment model. With service breadth spanning triple-play and Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services, reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and operating expenses (OpEx) can be achieved from a single ETTH and ETTB access solution.

   he Nexus 5500 series switch is an all new design from Cisco. It supports in-line rate 10 Gigabit Ethernet on all ports while still creating low latency and superior dependability. These switches connect over Fibre Channel Over Ethernet (FCoE). FCoE is a technology that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames over Ethernet networks. Fibre channel is what gives these series the ability to operate on 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks. The Cisco Nexus 5000 series also provides the flexibility to connect directly to servers using 10GBASE-T connections or fiber with Enhanced Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP+) transceivers.

  A switch will either work at layer 2, the data link layer in the OSI model, or at layer 3 – the network layer that supports routing. The majority of networking switches use Ethernet ports while the other switches are based on fiber channel, Infinitude, and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM).
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally, a networking switch irrespective of type should help network admins and other IT professionals to:
 </p>
 <p>
  Configure settings for bandwidth and duplex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Configure port mirroring to allow traffic monitoring
 </p>
 <p>
  Enable MAC filtering as well as other access control features.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enable or disable specific ports
 </p>
 <p>
  Set up the quality of service levels for specific ports
 </p>
 <p>
  Set up SNMP monitoring of devices

  Dell’s SonicWall range has had a gap in its security appliance portfolio for some time. Enterprises have had to choose between the carrier-class Super Massive  family or the physically inferior NSA E-Class appliances.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Super Massive 9000 appliances remedy this as they offer the same features as their bigger brothers but in a more compact, powerful hardware package
 </p>
 <p>
  Tested and well maintained by professional team,working in A Grade condition.

  Whether you’re an overachiever or an up-and-comer, ThinkPad laptops are the tools you need. From the thin-and-light wonder to the heavy-duty mobile workstation, they’re built, tested and enhanced for reliability, durability and speed. ThinkPad notebooks endure a lot before they ever reach you. We meticulously design many of them to pass rugged military spec tests. We outfit them with spill-resistant keyboards, roll-cage technology and shock-mounted hard drives. And we test them in ways you can’t imagine – baking, battering, blistering and blowing them with sand.

  The S3300 Series are a new generation of Gigabit Stackable Smart Switches which have four (4) 10G ports, which can be used for uplinks and/or stacking between other S3300 switches. Mixed stacking with select M4300 10G switches (12X12F and 24X) allows 10G architecture that can both scale as organization networks grows and be powerful enough for server and storage applications. As SMBs produce and consume more data, Gigabit to the desktop increasingly needs to be underpinned with 10GbE connectivity to the core to ensure a consistent, seamless user experience. This new generation of switches provides SMB customers with the most cost-effective 10G connections between the access and aggregation layer of the network.
